PHASE 2 - CURRENT NODE/PNPM/VITEST/V8 ENV

Node version: v23.11.0
Pnpm version: 9.0.0
Vitest version: vitest/2.1.9 darwin-arm64 node-v23.11.0

Rollup why:
rollup 4.55.1 is installed via vite 5.4.21 (peer dependency of vitest)

@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64 why:
@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64 4.55.1 is installed (this is the correct arch for our system)

@rollup/rollup-darwin-x64 why:
@rollup/rollup-darwin-x64 4.55.1 skipped (expected, we're on arm64 not x64)

ANALYSIS:
- Node v23.11.0 is non-LTS, known for native module compatibility issues
- Rollup native binaries are installed but Node 23.x has module resolution bugs
- The error message explicitly mentions "npm has a bug related to optional dependencies"
- This is a Node version compatibility issue, not a missing dependency issue
