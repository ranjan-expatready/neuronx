PHASE 6 - EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER NODE 22 SWITCH

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER LOCAL NODE SWITCH TO 22:
- rm -rf coverage
- pnpm -w test:coverage
- Should complete without rollup native module errors
- Coverage directory should contain:
  - coverage/coverage-summary.json (main file)
  - coverage/lcov-report/ (HTML report)
  - coverage/coverage-final.json (detailed data)
  - Other coverage artifacts

EXPECTED COVERAGE SUMMARY CHECK:
- ls -la coverage: Should show multiple files including coverage-summary.json
- find coverage -maxdepth 2 -type f: Should list JSON, HTML, and text files
- jq '.total.lines.pct' coverage/coverage-summary.json: Should return a number (e.g., "18.57")

CURRENT STATUS:
- Cannot verify locally due to Node version constraints
- CI will use Node 22 and should work
- Fix is implemented and documented for user to apply locally
