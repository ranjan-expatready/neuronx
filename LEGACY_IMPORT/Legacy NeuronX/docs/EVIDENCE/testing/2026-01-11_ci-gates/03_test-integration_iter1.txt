PHASE 2 - FIXES ITERATION 1

Changes made:
1. Fixed GHL controller response bug (removed invalid res.status() usage)
2. Updated global mocks to return resolved promises by default
3. Simplified NestJS module setup to use mocked controller instances directly
4. Fixed validHeaders scope issue in Security Guarantees tests

Command: pnpm -w test:integration
Exit code: 1

Still failing. Need to configure mocks to return appropriate promises (resolve/reject) for each test case.
