PHASE 7 - CI PARSER COMPATIBILITY (EXPECTED)

EXPECTED CI PARSING AFTER FIX:
- grep approach (ci.yml): grep "lines" coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'
  - Expected: Returns coverage percentage (e.g., "18.57")
- jq approach (pr-quality-checks.yml): jq '.total.lines.pct' coverage/coverage-summary.json
  - Expected: Returns coverage percentage (e.g., 18.57)

BOTH SHOULD WORK because:
1. coverage/coverage-summary.json will exist
2. JSON structure will contain total.lines.pct field
3. Both parsing methods are designed for this exact structure

CURRENT STATUS:
- Cannot test locally due to Node version
- CI workflows updated to use Node 22 (compatible)
- Parser logic is unchanged and should work with generated coverage files
