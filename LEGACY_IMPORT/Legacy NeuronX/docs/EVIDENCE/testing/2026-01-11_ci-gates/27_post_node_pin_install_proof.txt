PHASE 5 - NODE LTS PINNING CHANGES

FILES MODIFIED:
1. .nvmrc - Created with "22" (LTS Node version)
2. .github/workflows/ci.yml - Changed node-version: '20' to node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
3. .github/workflows/pr-quality-checks.yml - Changed node-version: '20' to node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
4. package.json - Updated engines: "node": ">=22 <23"

REINSTALL STATUS:
Cannot perform clean reinstall in this environment due to Node version constraints.
Local environment is still on Node v23.11.0.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER LOCAL NODE SWITCH:
1. User runs: nvm use (to switch to Node 22)
2. rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
3. Rollup native binaries should resolve correctly
4. Coverage should generate successfully

This fix aligns CI (Node 22) with local development requirements.
