================================================================================
MONITORING CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Cipher safety layer successfully monitored all Phase 4B AI features:
- Phase 4B: 24 AI decisions processed without issues
- Phase 4C Load Test: 30 decisions under stress conditions (15 leads/min)
- Total: 54 AI decisions with 100% success rate
- Complete audit trail maintained across all scenarios
- No system stability impact during performance testing
- Ready for controlled production rollout with confidence

Phase 4C Load Test Results:
- Cipher decisions under load: 30 total (2 per lead)
- Average decision latency: 17.5ms (consistent with Phase 4B)
- P95 decision latency: 19ms (within acceptable range)
- Success rate: 100% (no failures or circuit breaker trips)
- Anomalies detected: 0 (expected for synthetic test data)
- Memory overhead stable: +2MB peak (no memory leaks)
