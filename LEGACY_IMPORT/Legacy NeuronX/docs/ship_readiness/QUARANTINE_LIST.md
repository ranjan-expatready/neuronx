# Test Quarantine List

This document lists tests that are currently skipped or excluded from the mandatory "Ship Readiness" verification. All quarantined tests must have a tracked backlog item for resolution.

## Policy
1.  **Quarantine Criteria**: Tests that are flaky, broken due to known issues, or pending refactor.
2.  **Tracking**: Every quarantined test must be linked to a Backlog Item.
3.  **Resolution**: The goal is to fix and un-quarantine tests, not delete them.
4.  **Metadata**: Each entry must include Target, Category, Reason, Tracking ID, and Owner.

## Quarantined Items

| Target | Category | Reason | Tracking ID | Owner | Date Quarantined |
