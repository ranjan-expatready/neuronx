# Continue Agent Rules

**Canonical rules live in [/AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)**

This directory contains Continue-specific rule overrides and extensions. For all general agent governance rules, see the canonical [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) file.

## Continue-Specific Rules

The following rules are specific to Continue IDE integration and supplement the canonical rules:

- [FAANG_GOVERNANCE.md](FAANG_GOVERNANCE.md) - FAANG-grade quality and evidence standards
- [SSOT_BOOTSTRAP.md](SSOT_BOOTSTRAP.md) - Core agent bootstrap and governance requirements

## Rule Priority

1. **Canonical Rules** ([/AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)) - Primary governance source
2. **SSOT Documents** (docs/SSOT/) - Detailed implementation guidance
3. **Continue Overrides** (this directory) - IDE-specific adaptations

## Updates

When updating agent rules:
1. Update canonical [/AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) first
2. Add Continue-specific overrides here if needed
3. Ensure compatibility with Cursor agent rules
