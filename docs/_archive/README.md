# Documentation Archive

**Deprecated Documentation Repository** | **Historical Preservation** | **No Active Use**

This directory contains documentation that has been deprecated or superseded. Files are moved here to preserve institutional knowledge while preventing confusion with active documentation.

## Archive Policy

### When to Archive

Documentation is moved here when it meets ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Superseded**: Replaced by newer, more accurate documentation
2. **Redundant**: Content duplicated in canonical SSOT documents
3. **Outdated**: No longer reflects current architecture or processes
4. **Verified**: Team consensus that the document is no longer needed

### Archive Process

When moving documentation to archive:

1. **Add Deprecation Header**: Prepend this header to the archived file:

   ```markdown
   ---
   **DEPRECATED**: This document has been superseded.
   **Date Archived**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Reason**: [Brief explanation]
   **Replacement**: [Link to current canonical document]
   **Contact**: [Person who archived, if needed]
   ---
   ```

2. **Update References**: Search codebase for references to the archived document and update them

3. **Update Archive Index**: Add entry to this README with deprecation details

## Currently Archived

*None at this time. This directory is prepared for future archival needs.*

## Restoration Process

If archived documentation needs to be restored:

1. **Business Justification**: Document why the content is needed again
2. **Review**: Architecture team reviews restoration request
3. **Update**: Bring content current before restoration
4. **Approval**: Engineering leadership approves restoration

## Maintenance

- **Quarterly Review**: Review archived content for permanent deletion
- **Searchability**: Keep archive searchable for institutional knowledge
- **No Links**: Do not link to archived documents from active documentation

**Policy**: Archive preserves history without cluttering active documentation | **Contact**: Engineering leadership for archival decisions
