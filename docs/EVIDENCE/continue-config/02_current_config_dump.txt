# IMPORTANT: Restricted roles to ["chat", "edit", "apply"] for all specific models
# to prevent "Invalid role: thinking" errors that occur when Continue internally
# generates "thinking" roles for certain operations, but the underlying APIs
# (like Gemini) don't support them. Only AUTODETECT keeps extended roles.
