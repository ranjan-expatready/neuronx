PHASE 2 - WORKTREE HYGIENE TRIAGE

Repo State Analysis:

1. REPO ROOT: /Users/ranjansingh/Desktop/NeuronX ✅ (correct location)

2. GIT REMOTE: origin	https://github.com/ranjan-expatready/neuronx.git ✅ (proper remote)

3. TRACKED FILES COUNT: 48 files
   - This is extremely low for a project of this scope
   - Indicates this is a snapshot/copy of a larger repo

4. UNTRACKED FILES: Massive tree including:
   - apps/ (entire application directories)
   - docs/ (documentation tree)
   - .continue/, .cursor/ (IDE configurations)
   - .github/workflows/ (CI/CD files)
   - packages/, scripts/, etc.

5. MODIFIED FILES (tracked): 10 files with 318 insertions, 65 deletions
   - Mostly configuration/docs changes
   - No core application code changes in diff

6. DIFF FILES:
   - .cursor/rules/30_testing_contract.mdc
   - .github/pull_request_template.md
   - .github/workflows/ci.yml
   - docs/ENGINEERING_PLAYBOOK.md
   - memory/ files (CHANGLOG_AI.md, KNOWN_ISSUES.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
   - package.json
   - pnpm-workspace.yaml
   - vitest.config.ts

CONCLUSION: This appears to be a repo snapshot with minimal git history. The massive untracked tree suggests files were copied but not committed. For Gate 1 closeout, we must only commit our specific changes to avoid polluting the commit history.

CLASSIFICATION:
Bucket 1 (Gate 1 only): Our test fix, evidence folder, memory update
Bucket 2 (Unrelated noise): Everything else in the untracked tree
