Step 2.3 - LINES PCT TRUTH

EXPECTED COMMAND (after coverage-summary.json exists):
jq '.total.lines.pct' coverage/coverage-summary.json

EXPECTED OUTPUT UNDER NODE 22:
18.57

OR SIMILAR VALUE (the actual baseline coverage percentage)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Numeric percentage value returned
- This value is what CI will compare against 85% threshold
- Current baseline is ~18.57% (from previous SSOT memory)

CURRENT STATUS: Cannot verify - requires Node 22 locally
NEXT STEP: Once verified, we can work on raising from 18.57% → 85%
