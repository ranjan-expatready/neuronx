PHASE 5 - RECONCILE CI PARSER VS VITEST OUTPUT

GATE 2 STATUS: FAIL (exit code 1)
ROOT CAUSE: Filesystem ENAMETOOLONG error prevents coverage execution

OBSERVED COVERAGE %: NONE (run failed before any tests executed)

VITEST THRESHOLDS ENFORCEMENT:
- Vitest config has thresholds: 85% for lines/functions/branches/statements
- reportOnFailure: true (should show coverage even on failure)
- But: ENAMETOOLONG error occurs before any coverage processing

CI PARSING LOGIC:
- CI workflow: grep "lines" coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'
- PR checks: jq '.total' coverage/coverage-summary.json
- Both expect coverage/coverage-summary.json to exist

ACTUAL RESULT:
- No coverage-summary.json exists (confirmed)
- No coverage data generated at all
- CI parsing would fail because file doesn't exist

WHY CI WOULD FAIL:
1. pnpm test:coverage exits 1 (filesystem error)
2. Even if it didn't fail, coverage/coverage-summary.json wouldn't exist
3. CI grep/jq commands would return empty or error
4. Coverage comparison would fail

EXACT MISMATCH:
- Expected: coverage-summary.json with total.lines.pct >= 85
- Actual: No coverage files generated due to ENAMETOOLONG filesystem error
- CI would see: "Coverage: 0%" or parsing error

BLOCKING ISSUE: Filesystem path length limit exceeded due to circular node_modules dependencies prevents any coverage execution.
