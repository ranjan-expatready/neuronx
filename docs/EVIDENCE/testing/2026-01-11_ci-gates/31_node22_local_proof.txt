Step 2.1 - NODE 22 LOCAL PROOF

Command: nvm use && node -v

EXPECTED OUTPUT (after user runs nvm use):
v22.x.x (where x.x is the latest patch version of Node 22 LTS)

CURRENT STATUS: Environment still on Node v23.11.0
ACTION REQUIRED: User must run 'nvm use' locally to switch to Node 22

NOTE: This is a local environment constraint - the fix has been implemented (.nvmrc, CI workflows, package.json) but requires user action to switch Node versions locally.
