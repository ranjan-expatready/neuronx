PHASE 5 - APPLY MINIMAL FIX

ROOT CAUSE CLASS: B - Self-referential dependency / circular workspace link

EVIDENCE:
- ENAMETOOLONG path shows alternating @neuronx/decision-engine ↔ @neuronx/execution-authority
- decision-engine/package.json depends on "@neuronx/execution-authority": "workspace:*"
- execution-authority/package.json has "@neuronx/decision-engine": "workspace:*" in peerDependencies
- This creates circular dependency: A depends on B, B depends on A

MINIMAL FIX:
Remove circular dependency by eliminating the peerDependency reference from execution-authority back to decision-engine.

FILE CHANGED: packages/execution-authority/package.json
LINE NUMBERS: 22-27 (peerDependencies section)

BEFORE:
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@neuronx/playbook-engine": "workspace:*",
    "@neuronx/decision-engine": "workspace:*",  // ← REMOVED: circular reference
    "@neuronx/pipeline": "workspace:*",
    "@neuronx/playbook-governance": "workspace:*"
  }

AFTER:
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@neuronx/playbook-engine": "workspace:*",
    "@neuronx/pipeline": "workspace:*",
    "@neuronx/playbook-governance": "workspace:*"
  }

git diff:
- "@neuronx/decision-engine": "workspace:*",
