PHASE 1 - CI TRUTH PROOF (LINE-NUMBERED)

CI Workflow Coverage Threshold Enforcement:

CI WORKFLOW (ci.yml):
- Line 55-56: Runs "pnpm run test:coverage"
- Line 58-79: "Verify coverage threshold" step
- Line 61: if [ -f "coverage/coverage-summary.json" ]; then
- Line 62: COVERAGE=$(grep "lines" coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -o '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' || echo "0")
- Line 73-76: Requires >= 85%, exits 1 if below

PR QUALITY CHECKS WORKFLOW (pr-quality-checks.yml):
- Line 40-41: Runs "npm run test:coverage"
- Line 43-53: "Coverage validation" step
- Line 45: COVERAGE=$(jq '.total' coverage/coverage-summary.json)
- Line 48-50: Requires >= 85%, exits 1 if below

KEY DIFFERENCES:
- CI workflow: Uses grep to extract "lines" percentage from JSON
- PR checks: Uses jq '.total' to extract total object from JSON
- Both require 85% threshold
- Both run pnpm/npm run test:coverage

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- coverage/coverage-summary.json should exist after test:coverage
- JSON should contain coverage percentages
- CI expects to parse lines % from this file
