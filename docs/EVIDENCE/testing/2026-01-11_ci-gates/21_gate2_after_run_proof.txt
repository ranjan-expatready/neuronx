PHASE 7 - RERUN GATE 2 (AFTER FIX)

Command: pnpm -w test:coverage 2>&1 | tee /tmp/gate2_after.log ; echo "EXIT=$?"

EXIT=1 (but different error - ENAMETOOLONG fixed!)

COVERAGE ARTIFACTS:

NODE CHECK RESULT:
no coverage-summary.json

ROOT CAUSE PROGRESS:
✅ ENAMETOOLONG error FIXED - circular dependency resolved
❌ New issue: rollup native module missing (@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64)
   - This is a separate npm/pnpm issue, not the original filesystem problem
   - Coverage process now starts but fails at rollup initialization

IMPACT:
- Filesystem path length issue resolved
- Coverage collection can begin (no more ENAMETOOLONG during file traversal)
- But fails at tool initialization due to missing native dependency

NEXT STEPS:
- Fix rollup native dependency issue
- Then coverage artifacts will be generated successfully
