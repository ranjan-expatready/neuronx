# Gate 1 Results: pnpm -w test:integration

**Command**: pnpm -w test:integration
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-12T14:50:00Z
**Exit Code**: 1 (FAILED)
**Duration**: Timeout (>5 minutes)

## Command Output Summary

### Initial Setup
- Node version warning: Current v23.11.0, wanted >=22 <23
- Running Jest integration tests for rate limiting components

### Test Execution
- Tests started successfully, showing rate limit debug logs
- Rate limiting logic appears to work (allowed/blocked correctly)
- Tests progressed through various scenarios

### Failure Point
- Tests attempting Redis connectivity for rate limit store integration
- Redis connection failures: ECONNREFUSED on ports ::1:6379 and 127.0.0.1:6379
- Test suite timed out after extensive retry attempts

### Root Cause
**STOP-SHIP**: Redis service not running during integration test execution
- Integration tests require Redis for rate limit persistence
- Tests cannot complete without Redis connectivity
- This indicates infrastructure dependency issue

## Evidence Classification
- **Gate 1 Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Failure Mode**: Infrastructure dependency (Redis not available)
- **Severity**: HIGH - Blocks CI pipeline progression
- **Evidence Type**: Runtime failure with clear error diagnostics

## Next Actions Required
1. **Infrastructure Fix**: Start Redis service for integration tests
2. **Test Configuration**: Verify Redis connection parameters in test environment
3. **CI Setup**: Ensure Redis is available in CI environment
4. **Retry Gate 1**: Re-run after infrastructure fix

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check Redis status
redis-cli ping

# Alternative: Check if Redis process is running
ps aux | grep redis

# Check test configuration
grep -r "redis\|6379" apps/core-api/src/rate-limit/ --include="*.ts"
```
