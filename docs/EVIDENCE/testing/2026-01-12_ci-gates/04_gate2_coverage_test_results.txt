# Gate 2 Results: pnpm -w test:coverage

**Command**: pnpm -w test:coverage
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-12T14:52:00Z
**Exit Code**: 1 (FAILED)
**Duration**: 5.6 seconds

## Command Output Summary

### Initial Setup
- Node version warning: Current v23.11.0, wanted >=22 <23
- Vitest coverage enabled with v8
- Test run started successfully

### Failure Point
**STOP-SHIP**: Filesystem error during directory scanning
- Error: ENAMETOOLONG (name too long)
- Path: Extremely deep nested node_modules structure
- Scanning `/packages/decision-explainability/node_modules/@neuronx/execution-authority/node_modules/@neuronx/decision-engine/...` (repeated nesting)

### Root Cause Analysis
**Infrastructure Issue**: Path length exceeds filesystem limits
- Path contains 20+ levels of nested node_modules
- Indicates circular dependencies or incorrect package structure
- Coverage tool (v8) fails during directory traversal

## Evidence Classification
- **Gate 2 Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Failure Mode**: Filesystem/path length limitation
- **Severity**: HIGH - Blocks coverage analysis
- **Evidence Type**: Infrastructure failure with clear error diagnostics

## Impact Assessment
- **Coverage Measurement**: Impossible until path issue resolved
- **CI Pipeline**: Blocked from coverage validation
- **Quality Gates**: Cannot enforce 85% coverage requirement

## Next Actions Required
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Investigate circular dependencies in @neuronx packages
2. **Package Structure**: Fix incorrect nesting in decision-explainability package
3. **Filesystem Limits**: Consider using shorter paths or different filesystem
4. **Retry Gate 2**: Re-run after dependency structure fixed

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check path length issue
find packages/ -name "node_modules" -type d | head -5 | xargs ls -ld

# Check for circular dependencies
pnpm ls --depth=10 | grep -A 5 -B 5 "decision-explainability"

# Check package structure
find packages/decision-explainability -name "package.json" | head -3
```
