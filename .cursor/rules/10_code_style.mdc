# Code Style Standards

## Language-Agnostic Principles

### Readability First
- Code must be readable by humans first, machines second
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Write self-documenting code

### Consistency
- Follow established patterns within the codebase
- Use consistent naming conventions across languages
- Maintain uniform formatting and structure
- Align with industry standards for each technology

### Structure
- Organize code logically with clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate abstraction levels
- Keep functions and methods focused on single responsibilities
- Structure files for easy navigation

### Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully and predictably
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Fail fast with clear error information
- Log appropriately without exposing sensitive data

### Documentation
- Comment complex business logic
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep comments current with code changes
- Use consistent documentation formats

## Formatting Standards

### Whitespace
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces or 4 spaces)
- No trailing whitespace
- One blank line between logical sections
- Consistent line breaks

### File Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Order imports/dependencies consistently
- Separate public and private interfaces
- Use clear file naming conventions

### Code Metrics
- Functions should be < 50 lines when possible
- Files should be < 500 lines when possible
- Cyclomatic complexity should be kept low
- Avoid deep nesting (> 3 levels)

## Technology-Specific Rules

Rules for specific languages and frameworks will be added to this document as technologies are adopted. All language-specific rules must align with these core principles.
