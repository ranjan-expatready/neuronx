# Operating Mode

## Core Operating Principle

All development work MUST follow the **PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → DOCUMENT** loop.

## Plan Phase
- Understand requirements and constraints
- Break down work into manageable, verifiable tasks
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Create implementation plan with acceptance criteria

## Implement Phase
- Write code following established patterns
- Maintain code quality standards
- Include appropriate error handling and logging
- Keep changes focused and incremental

## Verify Phase
- Run automated tests if available
- Manual verification of functionality
- Code review against established rules
- Confirm no regressions in existing functionality

## Document Phase
- Update relevant documentation
- Record decisions in ADRs if architectural
- Update memory files with context changes
- Ensure PR documentation is complete

## Safety Protocols
- Never delete files without explicit approval
- Prefer incremental changes over large rewrites
- Stop and ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Maintain audit trail through git history

## AI-Assisted Development Expectations
- AI agents must follow these rules without exception
- All changes must be reviewable and understandable
- Governance and quality come before speed
- Repository must remain audit-ready at all times
