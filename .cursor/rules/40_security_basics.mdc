# Security Fundamentals

## Secrets Management

### Never Commit Secrets
- API keys, passwords, tokens, certificates
- Database connection strings
- Private keys or certificates
- Service account credentials
- Environment-specific configuration

### Secret Storage
- Use environment variables for development
- Use secure secret management systems for production
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Audit secret access patterns

### Detection and Prevention
- Pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
- Automated tools to detect leaked secrets
- Immediate revocation of compromised secrets
- Document incident response procedures

## Logging and Monitoring

### Logging Principles
- Log security events and authentication attempts
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Include sufficient context for debugging
- Use structured logging with consistent formats

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Alert on failed authentication attempts
- Track privilege escalation events
- Monitor for data exfiltration attempts

## Dependency Security

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Review licenses and security advisories
- Pin dependency versions in production

### Vulnerability Management
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI
- Immediate patching of critical vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment for non-critical issues
- Document security exceptions

## Access Control

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Regularly review and revoke access
- Use role-based access control
- Implement proper authentication

### Code Access Security
- Protect API endpoints with authentication
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Data Protection

### Data Classification
- Identify and classify sensitive data
- Apply appropriate protection levels
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention policies

### Privacy Compliance
- Minimize data collection
- Obtain proper consent for data usage
- Implement data subject rights
- Regular privacy impact assessments

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- Document security incident procedures
- Maintain contact lists for security team
- Prepare communication templates
- Regular incident response training

### Response Process
- Contain the incident quickly
- Assess impact and scope
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Learn and improve from incidents

## Security Reviews

### Code Review Security
- Security review for all code changes
- Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Validate security controls implementation
- Review third-party integrations

### Architecture Reviews
- Security review of system architecture
- Threat modeling exercises
- Security requirements validation
- Regular security architecture updates
