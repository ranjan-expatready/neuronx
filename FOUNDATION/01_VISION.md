# Autonomous Engineering OS
## The Operating System for Building Companies

Version: v1.0
Owner: Antigravity (CTO)
Ratified By: Founder
Status: CANONICAL

## 1. What We Are

Autonomous Engineering OS (AE-OS) is a **governed, auditable, self-driving software company in a box**.

It replaces:
- Product Management
- Engineering Management
- QA
- Release Management
- Security & Compliance
- Program Management

with:
> One AI executive (Antigravity),
> One AI workforce (Factory),
> One independent auditor (Trae),
> One cryptographically provable system of record (GitHub + Evidence).

This is not "AI coding".
This is **AI running a company**.

## 2. The Problem We Solve

Modern software companies fail because:
- Decisions are undocumented
- Changes are ungoverned
- Context is lost
- Reviews are biased
- Velocity trades off with safety
- Nobody knows the true state

This produces:
- Tech debt
- Security failures
- Slow delivery
- Inability to scale
- Founder burnout

AE-OS eliminates this by making **every action provable, reviewed, and resumable**.

## 3. The Breakthrough

AE-OS introduces three radical primitives:

### 3.1 Antigravity — The AI CTO
Antigravity:
- Reads the entire system state
- Plans all work
- Controls all execution
- Never writes code
- Never bypasses governance

It is the **brain of the company**.

### 3.2 Factory — The AI Engineering Org
Factory:
- Contains specialized Droids (Product, Code, QA, DevOps, Security, Knowledge)
- Executes plans
- Writes all code
- Produces all artifacts
- Never self-directs

It is the **hands of the company**.

### 3.3 Trae — The External Auditor
Trae:
- Is read-only
- Reviews plans and PRs
- Cannot write
- Cannot bypass
- Can veto or approve

It is the **independent board & regulator**.

Together they form a closed-loop governed company.

## 4. How Work Happens

1. Founder speaks to Antigravity
2. Antigravity creates a PLAN
3. Factory executes the PLAN
4. Trae reviews risk
5. CI validates reality
6. Evidence is recorded
7. State is updated
8. Antigravity resumes

Nothing skips a step.
Nothing bypasses review.
Nothing is lost.

## 5. What Makes This a $10M+ Product

AE-OS creates:
- Faster delivery than human teams
- Safer releases than enterprises
- Lower cost than startups
- Higher quality than FAANG

It enables:
- Solo founders to build companies
- Enterprises to govern AI
- VCs to fund autonomous teams
- Regulated industries to use AI safely

This is **the missing operating system of the AI economy**.

## 6. Our Long-Term Vision

Every serious company will run:
- On an autonomous OS
- With an AI CTO
- With governed execution
- With provable audit trails

AE-OS is that platform.

We are not building tools.
We are building **the future of how companies exist**.
