## Previously Blocked Items - Now Resolved ✅

### ❌ ~~governance-validator.yml 0 jobs issue~~

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED via PR #10

**Issue**: `.github/workflows/governance-validator.yml` was creating 0 jobs with 0s duration, blocking all governance validation

**Resolution**: 
- Replaced `governance-validator.yml` with canonical `.github/workflows/machine-board.yml` ✅
- Deleted `governance-validator.yml` to prevent conflicts ✅
- Jobs now create reliably on PR events ✅
- Graceful skip on push events ✅

**Evidence**: 
- PR #10: https://github.com/ranjan-expatready/autonomous-engineering-os/pull/10
- Commit: 751911461d7d2e320719a0f1fb37ae4d440316a9
- Actions: #21327980330 - machine-board PASS ✅

---

### ❌ ~~Jobs not creating on PR events~~

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED via PR #10

**Issue**: No jobs were being created when PRs were opened, breaking governance validation

**Resolution**:
- Fixed job execution logic in `machine-board.yml` ✅
- Removed problematic `if` conditions that prevented job creation ✅
- Verified 1 job created on PR events ✅

**Evidence**:
- Actions Run: #21327980330 - 1 job created ✅
- PR #10 commit: 751911461d7d2e320719a0f1fb37ae4d440316a9

---

### ❌ ~~Branch protection check name mismatch~~

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED via PR #10

**Issue**: Branch protection required "machine-board" check context, but workflow job was named "governance", causing merge blocked status

**Resolution**:
- Renamed job from "governance" to "machine-board" ✅
- Updated step IDs from `govern` to `machine-board` ✅
- Verified branch protection requires "machine-board" check ✅

**Evidence**:
- PR #10: job name "machine-board" now matches branch protection
- Branch protection API check: `["machine-board"]` ✅
- Actions Run: #21327980330 - machine-board check appears ✅

---

### ❌ ~~Conflicting governance workflows~~

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED via PR #10

**Issue**: Both `governance-validator.yml` and `machine-board.yml` existed, causing confusion and conflicts

**Resolution**:
- Deleted `governance-validator.yml` ✅
- Established `machine-board.yml` as single canonical workflow ✅
- Verified `governance-validator.yml` does not exist in HEAD ✅

**Evidence**:
- PR #10: governance-validator.yml deleted
- Commit: 751911461d7d2e320719a0f1fb37ae4d440316a9
- File check: `.github/workflows/` now contains only `machine-board.yml`, `ci.yml`, `release.yml` ✅

---

### ❌ ~~PR #8 Operating Manual not merged~~

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED via PR #10

**Issue**: PR #8 for Operating Manual was open but had no machine-board check run

**Resolution**:
- Operating Manual content merged indirectly via PR #10 ✅
- `RUNBOOKS/OPERATING_MANUAL.md` now exists on main ✅
- PR #8 auto-closed when branch rebased to match main ✅

**Evidence**:
- File exists: `RUNBOOKS/OPERATING_MANUAL.md` (12,071 bytes) ✅
- Commit: 751911461d7d2e320719a0f1fb37ae4d440316a9
- PR #8 state: CLOSED (auto-closed)

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: LOW 🟢

**Rationale**:
- All framework components complete and stable
- Machine Board governance operational and passing
- No active blockers
- All processes documented
- Rollback plans exist

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Governance workflow failure | Single canonical workflow, PR #10 validated ✅ | ✅ MITIGATED |
| State inconsistency | STATUS_LEDGER.md updated after every meaningful state change ✅ | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Product vision misalignment | Explicit founder approval gates for product definition ✅ | ✅ MITIGATED |
| SDLC process failure | End-to-End simulation before actual MVP development ✅ | ✅ MITIGATED |

---

## blockers Cleared Summary

| Blocker | Resolution | Evidence |
|---------|------------|----------|
| governance-validator.yml 0 jobs issue | Replaced with canonical machine-board.yml ✅ | PR #10, Actions #21327980330 |
| Jobs not creating on PR events | Fixed job execution logic ✅ | PR #10 commit |
| Branch protection check mismatch | Renamed job to "machine-board" ✅ | PR #10, branch protection API |
| Conflicting governance workflows | Deleted governance-validator.yml ✅ | PR #10, file check |
| PR #8 not merged | Content merged via PR #10 ✅ | Commit 7519114 |

**Total Blockers Cleared**: 5/5 ✅

**Active Blockers**: 0

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Application Code Missing**: APP/ directory is empty - intentionally awaits product definition
2. **SDLC Board Automation Pending Web UI Configuration**: Automation rules documented and configuration protocol created, but requires manual configuration via GitHub Projects web UI (not automated via GraphQL API due to API limitations)
3. **No Production Deployments**: Framework complete, no products to deploy yet
4. **No Incident Management System**: INCIDENTS/ directory not yet created (will be created when needed)

**Note**: These are not bugs or blockers - they represent intentional deferral of product-specific work until framework is stable.
